Reflecting on Principle
-----------------------
1. What is "duck typing" and what does it have to do with polymorphism?
  - "If it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck then it probably tastes like a duck too."
  - Duck typing is when an object implements the expected methods to pass messages with.
    - This ties in to polymorphism where you could have several different objects but
      they respond to the same message.
  - The message call doesn't require the caller to know of the implementation.
    - It just asks that the duck quacks and it does.
  - "Place the trust in the ducksâ„¢" #trustworthyObjects
2. What are some common code smells that indicate the need for relying on a
   "duck type" rather than a concrete class?
   - The big one is a switch statement that checks what the class type is.
   - In Ruby there are also some trigger words such as: `kind_of?`, `is_a?`, `responds_to?`
3. True or False: Abstractions like duck typing make code explicitly easier to
   understand, vs. using concrete types.
   - False; it requires more understanding, but it's easier to change and makes for a better tomorrow.
